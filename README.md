#  Linear Regression Model API (Flask + NumPy)

A simple machine learning project that demonstrates how to train a Linear Regression model using **Gradient Descent**, scale data, save the model, and expose it as a REST API using **Flask**.

This project is beginner-friendly and shows how machine learning models can be used in real applications.

##  Features

- Train a multivariable linear regression model with gradient descent  
- Standardize input features (mean/standard deviation scaling)  
- Save and load trained model
- REST API endpoint `/predict`
- Supports single or batch predictions  
- Works with JSON input
